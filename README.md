# AI-Enabled Dynamic Tolling System

This project implements an AI-enabled dynamic toll collection system that adjusts toll prices in real-time based on traffic conditions, vehicle types, and environmental parameters. The system aims to optimize traffic flow and revenue generation using intelligent decision-making.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using computer vision
- Dynamic toll calculation using machine learning
- Dashboard for toll operators
- Historical data logging
- License plate recognition (optional module)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (ML model)
- Flask (for the web interface)
- SQLite or MongoDB (for data storage)

## üîß Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RahulGowda19/AI-ENABLED-DYNAMIC-TOLLING-SYSTEM.git
cd AI-ENABLED-DYNAMIC-TOLLING-SYSTEM
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
